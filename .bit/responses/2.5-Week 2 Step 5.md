## Getting Emotional ~ Calling the Giphy API

Week 2 Step 5 ‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚¨§‚óØ‚óØ‚óØ | üïê Estimated completion: 5-10 minutes

### ‚úÖ Task:
**Call the GIPHY API with the dominant emotion of a picture**
- [ ] Create a GIPHY account
- [ ] Generate an API key and save it as a Function App Secret
- [ ] Create a new Azure function called `emotionHandler`
- [ ] Call the GIPHY API in a `GET` request
- [ ] Commit your updated function code to `Getting-Emotional/index.js`

## Using the GIPHY API
We're going to connect the your first Azure function, `emotionalgifs`, with the GIPHY API.

### Creating a GIPHY Account
Set up an account by clicking [here](https://giphy.com/join) and enter an **email address**, **username**, and **password**.

### Generating an API Key
According to the [documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search), an API key is a required parameters in a call to GIPHY's **search endpoint**. The link (for gifs) that is listed in the documentation is the **endpoint** we will be using in this project.

</br>

To create an **API key** click [here](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/) and click Create an App. <br>

Select API, **not** SDK! <br>

Then, enter the required information. <br>

Finally, click Create App, and your key should be given!

### Creating a new Azure Function
Create a new HTTP trigger function in the same function app as your first function, `emotionalgifs`. Call it `emotionHandler`.

As with our other function, we need to be able to use `node-fetch`. Outside of the async function, declare the variable `fetch` (like we did in our other function):
```js
var fetch = require('node-fetch');
```

<summary>‚ùó Calling the GIPHY API</summary>
</br>

Inside the async function, remove most of the code so that it looks like this:
```js
module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: //LEAVE THIS BLANK
    };
}
```

Now, we need to store the dominant emotion (sent in the **body** of the `GET` request) in a variable called `emotion`:
```js
const emotion = (req.query.//WHAT GOES HERE || (req.body && req.body.//WHAT GOES HERE));
```

We also need to store the phone number sent in the **body** of the `GET` request:
```js
const phone = (req.query.//WHAT GOES HERE || (req.body && req.body.//WHAT GOES HERE));
```

**Important to note:** the goal of this project is to find the dominant emotion of an inputted image and send a matching gif to the user's phone number!

Next, store your API key as a **function app secret** so it's **safe**!

Now, we're going to call the GIPHY API. HINT:¬†we need the dominant emotion to be passed through the **s** parameter of the **search** endpoint.
```js
const apiResult = await fetch ("https://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/translate?s=" + //WHAT GOES HERE + "&api_key=//PLACE YOUR KEY HERE");
```

We need to convert the content of `apiResult` into **JSON format**. Remember, we're using the `await` keyword because `fetch` (which we used to call the GIPHY API) returns a Promise, and a Promise is a **proxy** for a value that isn't currently known:
```js
const jsonResult = await apiResult.json();
```

Finally, we need to return a specific link from the JSON file stored in `jsonResult`:
```js
context.res = {
    // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
    body: //WHAT GOES HERE.data.images.downsized_large.url
};
```
