## Week 3 Step 2

### Calling the Giphy API

Open up the **HTTP trigger function** that you made last week. When it is run, the function should call the **Twilio API**. In this step, we're going to call the **Giphy API** in the trigger function!

*Note: do **NOT** use the first trigger function you coded in Week 1 – make sure you are working in the **Twilio trigger function!** Both should be in the same resource group, but they are **different** trigger functions!*

<details>
<summary>:question: Where is the documentation again?</summary>
  </br>
  
The documentation is here: https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#translate. This link has everything you need to call the **Giphy API.**

  <br><br/>

## **:pencil: Task 2: Call the Giphy API using the translate endpoint.**

_Note: **Node-fetch** must be installed for the code in this step to work! It should already be installed, but you need to require it in the first lines of code._

Once you are done, the function should call the Giphy API and **return the data** for a gif that matches the dominant emotion from your emotion data.

<summary>:exclamation: Can I get a more detailed list of steps?</summary>
  </br>
  
1. In the **async function**, create a new constant that will recieve the dominant emotion from your emotion data (i.e. angry, happy). This dominant emotion should be determined before you call on the trigger function.
2. Using **node-fetch**, call the Giphy **translate endpoint** from the documentation.
3. Run the constant through the **string** parameter in the endpoint (look as the documentation if this sounds confusing). Add your **Giphy API key**, and set the number of returned gifs to 1 by adding `&limit=1` to the endpoint.
4. Declare another constant that formats the results of the API call in **json** format.
5. Make this second constant the **output** of the function in `context.res`.

Fill in the gaps:
  
```js

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log(‘JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.‘);
    const phone = (req.query.phone || (req.body && req.body.phone));
    
    const emotion = (FILL_THIS_IN);
    
    const apiResult = await fetch (“ENDPOINT_GOES_HERE");
    const jsonResult = await ADD_CODE.json();
    
    context.res = {
        // status: 200, /* Defaults to 200 */
        body: jsonResult.data.images.downsized_large.url
    };
    
 ```

_Don't forget to have fun with the API – customize your call using the different parameters. Remember to use the gif and **not** the sticker endpoint!_

## **:camping: To move on, create and merge a pull request with your new `client.messages.create` code in `index.js` into the branch `week3`!**

*Remember: make your Giphy key and Twilio keys **environment variables** when you add them to your function!*
