## Week 2 Step 1
### [Parsing](https://oxylabs.io/blog/what-is-data-parser#:~:text=Data%20parsing%20is%20a%20method,be%20easily%20read%20and%20understood.) Multipart

#### Setting up the Emotion Reader Azure Function
Create **a new HTTP trigger function** in your Azure portal along with the Function App. Navigate to your Function App. **This is not the function code, but the actual app service resource**.

> In order to parse an image, we'll be using the `parse-multipart` package. [What is the parse-multipart package?](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart) Install it!

Be sure to add your **new Function url** to a secret named `FUNCTION_URL`!

#### Time to code
In your Azure Portal, go into your HTTP function you just created and into the index.js file. You should see starter code there that has something like `module.exports...`.
This is the file that we will be editing.

**The Azure Function needs to:**

1. Receive and parse an image from a webpage
2. Call the Face API and analyze the image

*What is happening in this flowchart?*

**HTML Page:** Where the user will submit an image; this page will also make a request with the image to the Azure Function.

**Azure Function:** Receives the request from HTML Page with the image. In order to receive it, **we must parse the image...**

### Concepts to know:
* Parsing data
* Node dependency packages
* Body and Headers of a request

*We're going to be focusing on Part 1, which involves parsing [multipart form data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4526273/what-does-enctype-multipart-form-data-mean).* 

### üìù Task 1: Analyze image input using the Face API and install `parse-multipart`.

<summary>‚ùì How do I parse image data?</summary>
</br>

In any HTML `<form>` element that receives involves a file upload (which ours does), the data is encoded in the `multipart/form-data` method. 

The default http encoding method is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, which encodes text into name/value pairs and works for text inputs, but it is inefficient for files or binary inputs. 

`multipart/form-data` indicates that one or more files are being inputted. Parsing this type of data is a little more complicated than usual. To simplify the process, we're going to use an npm library called `parse-multipart`.  

<details>
<summary>‚ùì How do I install parse-multipart?</summary>
</br>

To import Node packages, we use the `require`  function:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");
```

This imports the `parse-multipart`  package into our code, and we can now call any function in the package using `multipart.Function()`. 

Your function should look like this:

```js
var multipart = require("parse-multipart");

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
    context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.'); 
};
 
```

<summary>‚ùì What data is needed to parse the image?</summary>
</br>

Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-multipart for documentation and context on what the package does.  Look specifically at the example in the "Usage" section and what they are doing, as we're going to do something similar.

Notice that `multipart.Parse(body, boundary)`  requires two parameters.  I've already gotten the boundary for you ‚Äì just like the documentation example, our boundary is a string in the format `"----WebKitFormBoundary(random characters here)"`.

In the `multipart.Parse()` call, you need to figure out what the body parameter should be.

Hint: It should be the request body. Think about the example Azure function. How did we access that?

```js

//here's your boundary:
var boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers['content-type']);
  
// TODO: assign the body variable the correct value
var body = '<WHAT GOES HERE?>'

// parse the body
var parts = multipart.Parse(body, boundary);
```
</details>

## üèïÔ∏è To move on, add your function url to a secret named `FUNCTION_URL`, create a new branch called `week2`, and commit your new code to a file named `index.js`.
Once it successfully parses an image, you can move on!
