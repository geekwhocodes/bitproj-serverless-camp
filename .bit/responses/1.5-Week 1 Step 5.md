## One Cat Isn't Enough

### ✅  Task:

- [ ]  run `git pull` 
- [ ]  make sure you are in the `week1` branch 
- [ ]  create and deploy an HTTP trigger Azure Function that outputs TWO randomly generated cat pictures from the cat API and TWO names from list below
    * API endpoint: https://cataas.com/cat/cute/says/Bitcamp
    * List of names: "Shreya, Emily, Fifi, Beau, Evelyn, Julia, Daniel, Fardeen"
    * You should return the images encoded in **base64**
    * You should return the images and names in **JSON format** in the body
    ```js
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
    ```
- [ ] place your function URL in a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) called `SECOND_ENDPOINT`
- [ ] commit function code in a file named `week1/twocatz.js` to the `week1` branch

*Note: Every time you make a new commit to `week1`, we will check your function by making a request.*

### 🚧 Test your Work
When you paste your **Function URL** in your browser or make a GET request with **Postman**, you might get something like:
```json
{
  "cat1": "/9j/4AAQSk...",
  "cat2": "R0lGODlhCwHI...",
   "names": [
    "Daniel",
    "Shreya"
  ]
```
> :bulb: The Base64 is shortened for clarity!

### Return your images encoded in base64!
Base64 is *just another way to represent data.* We can also represent the number 11 or 0 in base64. Remember that the images you see on your screen are actually just numbers!

```js
base64data = Buffer.from(originaldata).toString('base64')
//put what you want to turn into base64 inside "original data"
//"originaldata" will be encoded in base64.
```

When we're coding websites, we can use base64 to display images on websites. The base64 outputted from your API can be used to create this:

Base64 encoding allows programs to encode binary data into text (ASCII characters) in order to prevent data loss. We do this since there are certain transfer channels that only reliably transfer text data, and this encoding method allows us to safely transfer images in the form of text.


**For fun:** Once your API successfully returns the images in *base64*, you can see what they look like using [this](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) website.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I make a request to the cat API?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint:** You should try using the `node-fetch` module, but there are many other ways to do it as you can see [here](https://www.twilio.com/blog/5-ways-to-make-http-requests-in-node-js-using-async-await).

<details>
<summary>🔵 I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Let's use the `node-fetch` module for this task. Install it on your Azure Portal console:

**Step 1: Install the module**
In the left tab, scroll down to **Console**.

![console](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52464195/93178238-cf5c4e00-f6e8-11ea-90ab-c42f746cf04e.png)

Enter these commands in order:

```sh
npm init -y 

npm install node-fetch
```
*If you're confused about what this "package" thing is, we'll explain more in depth in the next step.*

**Step 2: Add it to your code**
Add this line of code to reference the module at the top of your code:
`const fetch = require('node-fetch)`

2. Time to make the request!

```js
let resp = await fetch(THE_ENDPOINT, {
    method: 'GET'
});

let data = await resp.arrayBuffer()
// we need to receive it as a buffer since this is an image we are receiving from the API
// Buffer?? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
```
**Your turn!** What should you place in place of `THE_ENDPOINT`? Change the code.
> **Tip:** You're going to have to make two of these requests, so create two *different variables* for each request to get a different picture.

<summary>:exclamation: How can I select random items out of a list?</summary>
    </br>

**Hint 1:** You'll need to create an array with the names first.
**Hint 2:** You'll need to generate a random number within the range of the array length.

<details>
<summary>🔵 I'm still a little lost, some more help would be great!</summary>
    </br>

1. Create an array with the names:
```js
var names = ["name1", "name2"...]
```

2. Generate a random value in the correct range:
```js
var random_value = Math.floor(names.length * Math.random())
```

3. Get the name!
```js
var resultname = names[random_value]
```
*Do this two times to get two names!*

<summary>:exclamation: Now that I've got everything, how do I return it?</summary>
    </br>

`context.res` is the key to answering this question!

To return your two images and two names in the output:
```js
context.res = {
    body: {
        cat1: your-first-catpicture-in-base64,
        cat2: your-second-catpicture-in-base64,
        names: [name1, name2]
    }
}
```
