## Week 4 Step 4

### The Lightning Talk

Your final step is to prepare a 15 minute talk and demo of your project. Describe your vision, your process, and any challenges that occured. Use slides to enhance your talk through images, gifs, and perhaps short code snippets - *not* paragraphs of text.
