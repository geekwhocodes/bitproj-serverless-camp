<summary>:question: What is Giphy and how are we going to use it?</summary>
</br>

Giphy is a **database** for finding and sharing animated GIFs. We are going to use their API. An Azure HTTP trigger function (the same function that calls the Twilio API) will call the Giphy API using the **emotion data** we recieved. The Giphy API will find a GIF that matches the dominant emotion of the subject in the analyzed picture.

_This GIF will then be sent to the user with the Twillio API._
