## Week 4 Step 1

### Submitting Final Project Proposals

Congratulations! You're on the final stretch, and we'll now begin working on our final projects!

**Brainstorming:** If you don't have a project idea, don't worry! Here are some pointers to help you brainstorm.

Think about the problems you run into from day to day. Is there a solution to one that you can create using what you've learned in this course? If you can't think of any right away, try writing down the problems you observe over the course of a few days. This doesn't have to be limited to issues you face directly. You can expand your observations to include the experiences of friends, family, fictional characters, and people you've read or heard about. Go through your list and see if you can think of potential solutions to any of the problems.

Making a project from scratch doesn't mean the idea has to be brand new. Think about all the tools and technologies you use everyday. Is there anything you can reverse engineer and build your own version of? If you want to do something a little more challenging, try to see if you can improve upon the existing tool. Maybe you can build an extension or your own version with features that the original lacks.  

Lastly, Google is your best friend! If you still can't come up with your own idea, try searching for project ideas online. Many programmers have been in your position before and there are a huge number of resources for this. Feel free to use any idea you like, either directly or as inspiration to come up with your own. (Note: this does not mean copy an entire project from the Internet; rather, find a project idea that interests you and come up with your own way to build it using what you've learned).

### Proposal Instructions

**Flowchart:**  Create a flowchart on [draw.io](draw.io) that demonstrates how you will implement your solution. Your flowchart should show all APIs (including your Azure Function) that you will be using, and what data is being passed between each step.

For example: ![](https://github.com/thearchitectsnotebook/azure-functions-course/blob/master/images/proposal-flow-chart.PNG?raw=true)

**Getting Started:** Think about your overall project and try to break it down into components, or sets of code that interact with each other. If you're having trouble breaking it down, think of the project as a roadmap or sequence of steps starting at the user. What is the first thing the user does or interacts with? From there, trace through what happens from start to end. Each component should have an input and output that you can denote with arrows in the flowchart.

Make sure to think about the project carefully. It's easy to make a mistake and accidentally have one component that should actually be multiple, and vice versa. If an input is being modified multiple times within a component, maybe it should actually be a few components that have their own inputs and outputs. On the other hand, if you can't think of an input and output for a specific component, consider combining it with something else.

**Project Proposal:** Create a pdf of your flowchart and a description of your project. Include the problem that you aim to solve and describe how your project provides a viable solution. Please include any questions that you currently have or anticipate to have about your project’s implementation.

**To move on, commit the PDF of your project proposal to the repo, and comment a one sentence summary of what your project is about!**
