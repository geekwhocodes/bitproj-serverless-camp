## GitHub
*This week, you will be going through steps to set up tools needed to be successful in this camp. If you are already familiar with some, feel free to skip to the end and complete the task to move on.*

### ‚úÖ  Task:

- [ ]  **Optional**: complete the [get started with GitHub guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
- [ ]  Create a new branch named `test`
- [ ]  Add a paragraph introducing yourself under the `About Me` section in the `blog.md` file in root
- [ ]  Commit the change to `test`
- [ ]  Make a pull request to your main branch, naming it `Adding self introduction` and add a detailed description of your contribution
- [ ]  Merge the pull request


### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a industry-standard platform allows developers to save and collaborate on code. You can use GitHub to manage your files, changes in your project, version control (the ability to revert back to previous versions of your code as well as versions developed by other programmers), and more.


Check out <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">"The Github Flow"</a> for more information on issues, pull requests, committing, and branches!

If you want to learn more about <b>what it is</b> and <b>how to use it,</b> try taking <a href='https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github'>this</a> GitHub Learning Lab Course. After finishing it, you will have a strong understanding of all the features GitHub has to offer.

<summary>‚úçÔ∏èVocabulary</summary>

#### Repositories
Repositories (or repos) are essentially **folders where you can store files of code.** The repo of our camp was duplicated into your account when you clicked "Create Template" so that you can commit changes and complete each lesson.

#### Issues
For our camp, each week is placed inside an issue. Only when you complete the week (committing the necessary code and commenting), will the issue close and you can move on to the next issue. Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äì committing changes is easier than it sounds.

*On usual repositories in the contributing world issues are tasks or bugs that need to be completed or fixed.*

#### Fork
If you want to contribute to someone else's code, you would "fork" it. This creates a copy of the code under your account that you can make changes to. Create a fork when you **want to make changes to someone else's code and contribute to it.**
#### Branch
Creating a **branch** on a repository is like forking a repository. You would do this when you **want to make changes to your code without harming a working version.**
#### Pull Request
Once you make changes on **a forked repository or another branch,** you might need to bring the changes into the "main" repository. This allows YOUR changes to be visible in the main project! *You are basically asking for permission to "merge" your changes."
**This allows you to:**
* Collaborate on code
* Make comments
* Review the contributions made
#### Command Line Interface
A Command Line Interface (CLI) is your computer's visual application for accessing its operating system. There are different types of CLIs for different operating systems, such as Terminal for MacOs and PowerShell for Windows. If you have Windows, make sure to also install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for a better tool. In upcoming issues, we will refer to your CLI as your Terminal or Command Line, but remember that they mean the same thing!

> :bulb: Try to not use the web editor! Commit from your command line.

#### Commiting to a repository using a command line?

#### Setting up
Start out by [downloading Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Then, open your command line.

#### The commands
Navigate to the directory in your command line where you want to keep your repository.

> Tip: Use `cd ./your-directory` to change directories, `pwd` to find out where you are, and `ls` to list files & directories. More information is [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/bash-commands-to-manage-directories-files/). 

<details>
<summary>Cloning your repository</summary>
Click on "Code" on your repo's page and find your repo's HTTP link:

Enter this command **and replace the url** to get your repository's files onto your local computer.
```
git clone https://github.com/example/example.git
```

Now is the time to make your changes to your code!
</details>
<details>
<summary>Committing and pushing code</summary>
First, "stage" your changes. You will be specifying what files you want to commit the changes of.

Stage `helloworld.js` changes only:
```
git add helloworld.js
```

Stage ALL your changes to the repository:
```
git add -A
```

Next, let's commit the code. Usually, your commits will be a group of changes that make sense together. *Add a description!*
```
git commit -m "insert your description"
```

Save your commits to the repository on Github!
```
git push
```

#### Congrats! Your changes should now be visible on Github
:exclamation: *Don't forget to `git pull` before making any changes to your local repo!!* This gets any changes that were made by the bot.



Key functions you should be familiar with after this task include:
- Committing changes
- Forking a repository
- Making a new branch
- Making a pull request
